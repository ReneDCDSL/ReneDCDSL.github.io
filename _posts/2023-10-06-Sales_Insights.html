	<h1 id="C1">Overview of the Data and challenges</h1>

	<br>
	<h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
	<p>
		We have a dataset from Haardaveyar, a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients in India.

		The dataset contains 5 tables: <strong>customers</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>markets</strong>, <strong>products</strong> and <strong>transactions</strong> <br>
		Here is a small description of each of them:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>customers</strong>: it contains the identifier of the customers, their names, and a categorical value being either 'Brick & Mortar' or 'E-Commerce'</li>
			<li><strong>date</strong>: it contains several declinations of the date. The whole date and its 3 granularity (date, month, year), and a cy date column representing 
				the 1st of each month for business purposes.</li>
			<li><strong>markets</strong>: it contains the unique market identifiers with their associated name and a zone column, the location in the country</li>
			<li><strong>products</strong>: it contains the identifiers for each products. For each of them there is a category 'Own Brand' or 'Distribution' associated</li>
			<li><strong>transactions</strong>: 10 columns that recap the whole information of each transaction, from the customer, market and product IDs, to the sales amount, 
				profit and cost</li>
		</ul>		

	<h3 id="business_needs">Business needs</h3>
	<p>
		Our client is the head of the sales team. He would like to get a dashboard to have an overview of the current state of his company's sales. He wants to know in which 
		market/product/customer he should invest time and money.
	</p>

	<h5>Interpretation and research questions</h5>

	<p>
		From our understanding, the client wants a dashboard that can display the company's overall income while still being able to observe the performance of its market, customer and product 
		at a unit level. The dashboard should include various graphs and resources on an aggregated level with some charts that shows individual contribution. <br>

		In this context, investment rhymes with performance. Thus, the dashboard should be able to answer the following questions:
		<ul>
			<li>Which markets are the most profitable ?</li>
			<li>Which markets have been the most stable source of income ?</li>
			<li>Which markets have been performing well recently ?</li>
			<li>Which markets have been performing bad recently ?</li>
		</ul>
		
		The analysis will be conducted at a customer and product level as well, but first, let's take a look at our data.
		
	</p>


	<h3 id="eda">Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning</h3>

		In this case, since there are only 2 transactions that have been done in USD, we can either treat it as an outlier, compared to the huge amount of transactions made in Indian 
		Rupees, and remove it. Or we can just change the currency at the transaction date's exchange rate and keep the record. In this case, I kept the record.

	<br>
	<h3 id="kpi">Key Performance Indicator</h3>

	<p>
		To satisfy our customer's needs, we need measures that efficiently express the performance evolution of the different markets, customers and products sales.
		To do so, we will create 3 performance indicators: the Revenue, the Profit Margin Percentage, and the Average Percentage of Profit. These indicator will help us establish which 
		product, market or customer are the most profitable at an individual and overall scale. 
	</p>

	<h5 id="revenue">Revenue</h5>

	<p>
		The Revenue consists of the raw total income, which is the sum of the <em>sales_amount</em>. This variable is important as it illustrates the weight a market or customer represent 
		for our client. It can also show which product are staples for the consumers and source of stability for our client.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is the DAX formula to create the variable in Power BI:
		<pre class="sql-code">
Revenue&nbsp;=<br><span class="Keyword" style="color:#035aca">SUM</span><span class="Parenthesis" style="color:#808080">&nbsp;(</span>&nbsp;'sales&nbsp;transactions'[sales_amount]&nbsp;<span class="Parenthesis" style="color:#808080">)</span></pre>
		</p>


	<h5 id="profit_margin">Average Profit Margin %</h5>
	<p>
		The Average Profit Margin % is the percentage of profit among the total revenue on average. This indicator displays how profitable an item is. High profits transactions can arise from 
		various factors that should be investigated (new product, few or no opponent on the market..). This metric is very valuable as profits are what makes the company run. 
		Products and markets with high profits should be closely looked at, as a source of income and leverage for our client.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h5 id="profit_margin_percentage">Profit Margin Contribution %</h5>
	<p>
		The Profit Margin Contribution % is the relative profit of a given market, producer, or customer, across all the others. As a representation of the share of profit accross all other 
		terms, this metric exhibits which markets, products or customers are the most profitable to our client.

	<h3 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h3>

	<p>
		Using Power BI, I was able to create the following dashboard. It displays our 3 KPIs in various plots. We can change the granularity at many different levels: year, sales type or  
		the market contributor. This first dashboard shows the overall trend and accomplishment over the 4 years of focus.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="/img/posts/sales/dashboard/sales_dashboard_overall_markets.jpg">
		<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 - Overall dashboard with focus on Markets</figcaption>
	  </figure>

	<p>
		This first version of the dashboard showcases simple overall statistics: the total revenue, total profit, and total number of sales on the first line. The middle part of the board 
		presents the revenue trend over the 4 years, with a pie chart illustrating the amount of e-commerce vs local brick & mortar sales. Finally, the bar charts at the bottom show the 
		contribution of each market in the dataset through the revenue and profits KPIs. The bar charts can be changed to display the contribution at a customer and product level as well. 
	</p>

	<figure>

		<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure 2 - Overall dashboard with focus on Customers</figcaption>
	  </figure>

	<p>
	This second figure shows the relative income of the customers in 2019. We can see that Electricalsara Stores is one of the most important customer given the revenue and profits 
	our client generates from them. Looking at the top customers in each bar charts allows us to draw deeper insights. 
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="/img/posts/sales/dashboard/electricalsara_stores.jpg" style="width: 33%;"><img src="/img/posts/sales/dashboard/top5_revenue_wo_number1.jpg" style="width: 33%;"><img src="/img/posts/sales/dashboard/top7_profit_perc.jpg" style="width: 33%;">
		<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure 3/4/5 - Focus on Electricalsara Stores / Focus on top 6 Revenue without Electricalsara / Focus on top 7 Profit Margin %</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Thanks to the various variations of the dashboard, we can get really interesting insights on our client's sales. <br>
		On the first figure, we can see the importance of the Electricalsara Stores as the main source of Revenue and Profit of his company. Although, we can see through the third bar 
		chart that the average profit % is quite low, meaning that the hardware company generates overall a good amount of money over a huge number of transactions with very low profits. <br>
		The second figure shows that the following 5 customers who contribute to the revenue the highest have various shares of contribution towards global profit. We can see that Nixon and 
		Electricalslytical are 2 very great customers with which their company makes a significant number of transactions with fairly high profits. <br>
		The third figure on the right, shows which markets make the most profit out of each transactions. Since this is a relative number, top customers in this category present various 
		impacts on revenue. Again, Nixon is present in all top parts of the charts. Leader and Electricalsocity are also customers that bring consequent revenue and profit.
	</p>

	<h3 id="BI">Business Insights</h3>

	<p>
		Here are some high-level insights I would give my client with the appropriate dashboard illustrations: <br>
		<i><b>Note:</b> to showcase the performance, I added the individual KPI as such:<br> <strong>[% Revenue contribution/% Profit contribution/% Avg Profit per transaction]</strong></i>
	
		<h4>Overall</h4>
		<ul>
			<br><h6>Main customer: Electricalsara Stores <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/overall/overall_electricalsara_main.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				From 2017 to 2019, <strong>Electricalsara Stores</strong> have been the main contributors to the overall profit of my client's company. Indeed, these stores have been contributing 
				to more than a 3rd of the overall profit each year. This is their main client with which they are the most profitable and which generate them the most revenue. A small dip in 
				mid 2020 could be investigated.
			</li>
			
			<br><h6>Markets <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/overall/overall_top5_markets.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				<strong>New Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bhopal and Nagpur</strong> have always been the same top 5 markets in both revenue and overall profit contribution (5%-50%). These are 
				the strongest markets. <br>
				<a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/blob/main/dashboards/overall/overall_tier_B_markets.pdf"><strong>Kochi, Chennai, Patna and Surat</strong></a> are the main follow-up 
				with non-negligible profit contribution (0.5%-3%) and relatively high average profit per transaction (1.7%-4.9%). Except for Surat, these markets have been showing great performance in 
				early 2020 with very high profits both at an overall contribution and average transaction levels. These performance should be encouraged.
			</li>
			<br><h6>E-commerce status <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/overall/overall_e-commerce.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				Apart from Electricalsara Stores which are full Brick & Mortar, customers relying on E-commerce have been yielding our client's company the most profitable transactions. 
				These highly profitable transactions gives their company leverage to be taken advantage of (investing in more ads, promotions..)
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br><h4>2019: previous year performance</h4>
		<ul>
			<br><h6>Customers: Leader, Control, Logic Stores <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2019/2019_tier_A_profit_per_transa.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				<strong>Leader [1.9/6.7/11.1], Control [3/4.5/4.7] and Logic Stores [1.7/3.4/6.1]</strong> all had high average profit per transaction in 2019. Each of these stores 
				managed to have a transaction average profit of over 4.5%. These customers have been very profitable last year, keeping a good relationship with them is advised.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br><h4>2020: current trend</h4>
		<ul>
			<br><h6>Tier A products: 083, 070, 206, 308 <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2020/2020_tier_A_products.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				In the beginning of 2020, products <strong>083 [0.6/9.8/25.7], 070 [0.5/7.6/22.7], 206 [0.5/7.7/21] and 308 [1.5/14.8/14.2]</strong> have been the star products. 
				With a combined profit contribution of 39.9% despite their 3.1% cumulated revenue, and individual average profit of > 14% per transactions, these products have 
				been selling very well. Understanding why is key to strategize on how to take advantage of these.
			</li>
			<br><h6>Tier B products: 324, 159, 313, 332, 201, 318 <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2020/2020_tier_B_products.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				These products have had a higher share of the revenue (0.7%-1.2%) in the beginning of 2020, but with a lesser profit contribution (4.9%-6.4%) and profit per 
				transaction (6%-12.7%), except for product <strong>324 [3.5/7.9/3.3]</strong> which has high profit and revenue contribution rates but with a lower profit per 
				transaction of 3.3%. These products have had very great performance in this first half of the year, so I put them in this second, yet very good, tier as products to 
				investigate.
			</li>
			<br><h6>Market: Hyderabad <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2020/2020_hyderabad.pdf"><img src="/img/graph.jpg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; display:inline-block;"></a></h6>
			<li>
				The <strong>Hyderabad</strong> market has had a rough start in <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2017/2017_hyderabad.pdf">2017</a> 
				<strong>[1/-1/-3.1]</strong>, keeping low profile in <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2018/2018_hyderabad.pdf">2018</a> 
				<strong>[0.6/0.4/1.5]</strong>, before deeping down again in <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2019/2019_hyderabad.pdf">2019</a> 
				<strong>[0.8/-0.4/-1.5]</strong> but have risen back up in <a href="https://github.com/ReneDCDSL/Sales_Insights/tree/main/dashboards/2020/2020_hyderabad.pdf">early 2020</a> 
				<strong>[0.8/3.9/6.7]</strong>, with a record 0.55M in revenue in March. This sudden outbreak should be investigated
			</li>
		</ul>

		This work present high-level insights on this dataset, the points made here are only a fraction of the conclusion we can draw from this data. Further analysis can still be done: focusing 
		on specific market or customer to see which products work well/bad for them, taking one region of the country as a study case, check if seasonality has an impact on sales in some specific places...
		
	</p>

	<h3 id="final">Final remarks</h3>

	<p>
		This dashboard is a simple yet informative version of Haardaveyar company sales state. It displays revenue and profit metrics, sales trend and the top markets, customers or 
		products at any given time. It is a highly flexible dashboard, prone to change depending on the needs and questions at hand. <br>
